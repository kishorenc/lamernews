About
=====

"Let Me Beta" is a launch platform community for early-stage projects. We hope to provide a platform for hackers to showcase their ideas, generate feedback, and start a dialogue within the community.

This repository is a heavily modified fork of [Lamer news](https://github.com/antirez/lamernews).
